title: About Me

Hi! My name is **Nikita Popov**, but you'll mostly meet me as **nikic** on the internet. Currently I am 20 years old and
study computer science and physics at the Technical University of Berlin (Germany). My main area of interest is PHP, in
particular its internal aspects.

I maintain a [PHP parser written in PHP](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser), which can be used for static code
analysis and automated code manipulation.

Furthermore I'm contributing to PHP. In particular I implemented several features for PHP 5.5. Among them
are [generators and coroutines](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generators), as well as
[support for arbitrary expressions in empty()](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/empty_isset_exprs)

Feel free to contact me via [nikic@php.net](mailto:nikic@php.net). Alternatively you can usually find me in the
[PHP chatroom on StackOverflow](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php).
