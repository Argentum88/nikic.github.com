    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is <strong>Nikita Popov</strong>, but you'll mostly meet me as
        <strong>nikic</strong> on the internet. Currently I am 17, am in my last year of school and
        live in Berlin/Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am somewhat interested in web development, in particular using PHP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I only have one notable project, a
        <a href="http://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP parser written in PHP</a>. Also I am
        contributing to the English and German documentation.
    </p>

        You can contact me at <a href="mailto:nikic@php.net">nikic@php.net</a>.
